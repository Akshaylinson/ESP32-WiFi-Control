**ESP32 WiFi-Controlled Smart Switch with Web and Mobile App
**
Project Overview:-
This project enables users to control an ESP32 relay switch through a web-based interface and a mobile app created using Kodular. The ESP32 operates in Access Point (AP) mode, allowing users to connect and send ON/OFF commands without requiring an internet connection.

Key Features:-
âœ… ESP32 in AP Mode â€“ No external WiFi required, works locally.
âœ… Web-Based Control â€“ Users can access from a browser to control the relay.
âœ… Kodular Mobile App â€“ A custom-built app with a Web Viewer to control the relay.
âœ… Real-Time Status Monitoring â€“ Displays whether the ESP32 is Connected or Not Connected.
âœ… WhatsApp Support Integration â€“ Users can contact software support via a WhatsApp link.
âœ… Reload & Back Navigation â€“ Easily reload the interface and switch between screens.
âœ… Dark Mode Toggle (Planned Feature) â€“ A user-friendly dark mode for better UI experience.

How It Works:-
The ESP32 creates a WiFi hotspot, and users connect their mobile or PC to it.
A simple web interface (HTML/CSS) is hosted on the ESP32 at web server.
Users can press ON/OFF buttons to control the relay module connected to ESP32.
The Kodular app has a Web Viewer that loads the same interface for mobile use.
A status label shows "Connected" if ESP32 responds, else "Not Connected".
A reload button refreshes the page, and a back button returns to the main screen.
Users can click the WhatsApp Support button to contact technical support.

Technology Used:-
ESP32 (Microcontroller, AP Mode, Web Server)
HTML, CSS (For Web UI)
Kodular (For Android app development)
MQTT/HTTP Requests (For communication with ESP32)
